Procedure to merge a new gmfgen files where modifications are made.

1. Copy the not modified gmfgen to another location.
2. Generate the new gmfgen file.
3. Delete the unused first label parser located at :
	Gen Editor ... > Gen Parsers ... > External Parser
4. Save the modification.
5. Compare the new and old gmfgen files in text mode.
6. Using Ctrl+. or Ctrl+, , inspect each differences and merge from old to new file
	(using the Copy current change from left to right or right to left action)
	(take care that you do have only one compare editor opened) :
		- the addition of groups as containers of activity nodes
			(in containers attribute, addition of compartments 4 to 9)
		- the preferredSideName attribute for pins
			(WEST for input pins, EAST for output, NORTH for target)
		- the addition of activity nodes as children of groups
			(childNodes attribute of compartments)
		- the removal of ShapeNamedElementEditPart (/0/@diagram/@childNodes.69) from Activity children
		- copy/paste child node ShapeNamedElementEditPart
7. Other changes must not be merged. These should be among this list :
	- changes subsequent to modifications in the tooling files,
	- alteration of the order of usage in implementations of labelParsers,
	- addition of notationViewFactoryClassName attribute
		which are not generated the first time.
8. If some other changes in gmfgen file have been erased, do not merge them.
	This means these should have been done in the tooling files,
	rather than directly in the gmfgen file.
9. Save and close the merge.
